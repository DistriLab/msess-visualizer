# optional-transmit-label
This makes the labels in transmissions (global, per-party, per-endpoint, etc...) optional, so that the user doesn't have to manually keep track of all labels.

Transmit arrows without labels will be three dashes long (`--->`) because this format makes the code change trivial.
