- Maguire@Thinking with Types
  - Why use GADTs@It is this ability to specify the return type that is of 
    particular interest.  You might be pleased that Expr is correct by 
    construction. We are incapable of building a poorly-typed Expr.  While this 
    might not sound immediately remarkable, it is—we’ve reflected the typing 
    rules of Expr in the type system of Haskell. For example, we’re unable to 
    build an AST which attempts to add an Expr Int to a Expr Bool.
