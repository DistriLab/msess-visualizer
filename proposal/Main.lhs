\title{A Visualizer and Simulator for Session Protocols}

\begin{abstract}
Distributed software is ubiquitous in todayâ€™s digital world. The expert designers of distributed systems often engage formal techniques to provide an unambiguous description of such software. One rigorous trend in describing the communication/synchronization of distributed applications is that of multiparty session protocols. A multiparty session protocol describes the communication interaction between multiple peers, highlighting the order and the kind of transmitted messages.

Coming up with the right specification is often challenging due to the rather complex interaction schemes used within these systems. To ease the task of designing and writing session protocols and to test their feasibility before even implementing them, it would be appropriate to be able to visualize and simulate the intended communication. "One Look Is Worth A Thousand Words" they say! The goal is to have a visualization mechanism of session protocols that goes two ways. On one hand it generates a graphical display of the communication given the formal protocol. On the other hand, it should be able to allow the designer to interact with the graphical protocol such that any modification in the graphic protocol would also be captured by its formal counterpart.

\section{Overview}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{overview.png}
\end{center}

In this setting a user should be able to write a global protocol with
any of the following synchronized mechanisms:
(1) formal language in the style of session logic \cite{Andreea2017thesis},
(2) the DSL for visualizing a communication protocol,
(3) the GUI, which should provide a drag-and-drop facility for adding new
communicating parties and or transmissions.

Any change in one of these three layers should be uniformly reflected in
all the layers (either automatically or via a synchronization mechanism).

\subsection{DSL for Building and Simulating Session Protocols}

\begin{itemize}
  \item should follow that of the Formal Global Protocols as much as
    possible.
  \item split between {\it the static} part for building the visualization
    of the protocol, and {\it the dynamic} part for simulating the
    communication described by the protocol.
\end{itemize}


\noindent
\emph{\bf Static}.
\begin{verbatim}
  {program}       Prog          :== Parties_decl x Channels_decl x Transm
  {parties decl}  Parties_decl  :== Party P*
  {channels decl} Channels_decl :== Channel c*
  {transmissions} Transm        :==  P -(OPT color)-> P: c<msg(v)>
                                   | {Transm} * {Transm}
                                   | Transm ; Transm
                                   | {Transm} \/ {Transm}
                                   | loop(Transm)
                                   | end.

\section{Introduction}
\textit{ecce} is a module that deals with structured data and its
transformations.  This can be seen at every level of its implementation.
Parsing fails unless the input string is structured, and the resulting Abstract
Syntax Tree (AST) is structured.  Processing peels off single layers of
structure off of the AST.  Projection is a direct functional mapping between
data types.  Finally, the images shown to the user are also structured.

Functional programming is ideal to deal with such many disparate structures, as
it can express transformations between these structures succinctly.
Furthermore, we can encode bidirectional transformations as partial
isomorphisms, to avoid repeating similar code.

For example, code for parsing and pretty-printing are similar, in the sense
that there is a normal form of the AST that the parser and pretty-printer both
understand.  Encoding this normalized AST in the parser involves correctly
parsing the input string, and encoding this normalized AST in the printer
involves assuming the normalized AST already exists in that exact form.  This
double-encoding is tedious for the programmer to maintain, since a change made
in the parser mandates a corresponding change in the pretty-printer, and
vice-versa.

Partial isomorphisms are constructors that have both the parser and
pretty-printer functions in the same object.  The crucial idea is, the
programmer explicitly defines these two functions only in a base set of partial
isomorphisms, from which more complex partial isomorphisms are formed without
any more explicit definitions.  This work-saving technique is enabled by an
algebra of partial isomorphisms \cite{Rendel}.

\section{Types}
A diagram will summarize the structured data transformations in \textit{ecce}.
So, we give an overview of the type transformations in \textit{ecce} (Fig.
TODO).  Note that partial isomorphisms exist only for the \textit{String}
\leftrightarrow \textit{GlobalProtocol} transformation, since this is the
transformation that uses lexers and parsers already defined in the
\textit{invertible-syntax} package.  Partial isomorphisms for other
transformations are a work in progress.

\section{Modules}
In this section, we give an overview of each module in \textit{ecce}, and
explain the implementation.  The module dependencies are graphed in Fig. TODO.
