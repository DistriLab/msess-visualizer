# Installation
Run this command in the same folder as this README file:
```

```

Note: currently produces this error, without any explanation (could be linker 
error):

ExitFailure 1
```

## Main.hs
Within the GUI, use the same keybindings as for `Processor.hs`.

### Performance
Running either `Frontend.hs` or `Main.hs` in `ghci` often takes 100% CPU. To 
reduce CPU (and memory) usage, compile the Main module to generate the 
executable (`ghc Main.hs`), and then run the compiled executable (`Main`).
